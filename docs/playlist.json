    "summary_long": "Dogecoin posted a controlled rise within a tight intraday band, with buyers repeatedly defending the $0.213–$0.214 area and sellers leaning into the $0.220–$0.221 zone. Momentum improved on rebounds where volume rose above session norms, but late momentum fades kept price pinned just below resistance into the close. NEWS BACKGROUND * No confirmed catalyst headlines drove the move. The session was dominated by order-flow dynamics around $0.21 support and $0.22 resistance. Source: www.coindesk.com.

    "summary_long": "XRP jumped sharply in Monday’s session, climbing from $2.83 to $2.88 as a breakout push briefly tested $2.92 on six-fold average volume. Bulls held firm above $2.86 support, but repeated rejection at $2.90–$2.92 capped upside momentum. With Fed rate cut bets near 100% ahead of the September 17 meeting, institutional inflows remain strong — leaving the token consolidating just under critical resistance.
