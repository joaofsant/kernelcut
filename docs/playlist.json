    "summary_long": "Saving on rent often means paying on time. In many suburban areas, limited rail access and infrequent, often delayed bus services make everyday travel difficult. Shared electric mopeds (e-mopeds) have emerged as a new form of micromobility well suited for trips that are too long for walking but not long enough to justify using public transit. A study published in the Journal of Transport Geography in October 2025 shows that shared e-mopeds offer significant time savings over buses and rail, though high costs may prevent the people who need them most from fully benefiting.

The collaboration between The Pokémon Company International and Stern Pinball is undoubtedly nostalgic, letting you battle with a team that includes Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle and Pikachu, as well as catch up to 182 different Pokémon, mostly from the Kanto region, with more to be added. Besides catching 'em all and tracking your growing Pokédex on Stern Pinball's dedicated app, you can do Gym Battles in four different biomes and eventually face off against Team Rocket. The pinball machine draws a lot of inspiration from the original cartoon, including a monitor that plays clips from the show, an animatronic Pikachu, and speakers that can play the iconic theme song.

Gurman added that not all of these six colors will make it to the final product, but Apple has recently shown it's not afraid to dip into flashier options. Source: www.engadget.com. Date: 2026-02-15.
