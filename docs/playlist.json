This week, the network unveiled plans to build a shared ledger platform that will let banks settle transactions involving stablecoins and tokenized assets across multiple blockchains. While SWIFT has long served as the messaging layer for cross-border money movement, the new platform would put it closer to the center of value transfer. That’s a major shift for a more than 50-year-old traditional financial organization known for handling communications between more than 11,500 banks, not for moving money itself.

That delay puts USD1 out of step with rivals like Circle’s USDC, which published reserve data through August, and Tether, which reports quarterly, Greg Cipolaro, Global Head of Research at NYDIG, said in a report. “For a project of USD1’s stature, up-to-date attestations are non-negotiable,” Cipolaro wrote.

According to public records, ICE has put out a request for information — which allows the agency to detail its preliminary scope of work to gauge any interest from contractors — that details using social media platforms like Facebook, X, Instagram, TikTok, Reddit and YouTube to develop leads on wanted individuals. For \"urgent cases,\" the team is expected to work on leads with ICE's Top 10 Most Wanted within a 30-minute timeframe. However, the breadth of work ranges all the way to low-priority cases, like those involving someone convicted of a non-violent misdemeanor or \"has no convictions but has a significant arrest history,\" with a more generous eight-hour window to generate leads.
