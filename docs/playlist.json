    "summary_long": "One of Russia’s most important projects over the last 15 years has been the construction of the Vostochny spaceport as the country seeks to fly its rockets from native soil and modernize its launch operations. However, the initiative has been a fiasco from the start. After construction began in 2011, the project was beset by hunger strikes, claims of unpaid workers, and the theft of $126 million. Additionally, a man driving a diamond-encrusted Mercedes was arrested after embezzling $75,000. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-11-06.

In April, the group targeted a Ukrainian university with two wipers, a form of malware that aims to permanently destroy sensitive data and often the infrastructure storing it. One wiper, tracked under the name Sting, targeted fleets of Windows computers by scheduling a task named DavaniGulyashaSdeshka, a phrase derived from Russian slang that loosely translates to “eat some goulash,” researchers from ESET said. The other wiper is tracked as Zerlot. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-11-06. Why it matters: outline likely impact on technology, business, or society.

    "summary_long": "A common approach to mechanistic interpretability is to causally manipulate model representations via targeted interventions in order to understand what those representations encode. Here we ask whether such interventions create out-of-distribution (divergent) representations, and whether this raises concerns about how faithful their resulting explanations are to the target model in its natural state. First, we demonstrate empirically that common causal intervention techniques often do shift internal representations away from the natural distribution of the target model. Then, we provide a theoretical analysis of two classes of such divergences: `harmless' divergences that occur in the null-space of the weights and from covariance within behavioral decision boundaries, and `pernicious' divergences that activate hidden network pathways and cause dormant behavioral changes.

    "summary_long": "Urban surface water flooding, triggered by intense rainfall overwhelming drainage systems, is increasingly frequent and widespread. While flood prediction and monitoring in high spatial-temporal resolution are desired, practical constraints in time, budget, and technology hinder its full implementation. How to monitor urban drainage networks and predict flow conditions under constrained resource is a major challenge. This study presents a data-driven sparse sensing (DSS) framework, integrated with EPA-SWMM, to optimize sensor placement and reconstruct peak flowrates in a stormwater system, using the Woodland Avenue catchment in Duluth, Minnesota, as a case study.

Based on the theoretical results, we introduce a novel solution method for the fitting problem of RL models based on convex relaxation and optimization. Source: arxiv.org. Date: 2025-11-06.
