On Tuesday, OpenAI released a tool that reduces the process to typing a sentence. It’s not the first company to do so. While OpenAI had a conversational image-editing model in the works since GPT-4o in 2024, Google beat OpenAI to market in March with a public prototype, then refined it to a popular model called Nano Banana image model (and Nano Banana Pro).

Unlike the white backlights used on Mini LEDs, though, it uses tiny red, green and blue LEDs that produce more accurate colors and offer smaller and more controllable dimming zones. However, because pixels can't be turned on and off individually like Micro LED or OLED, Micro RGB contrast ratios aren't as high. Source: www.engadget.com. Date: 2025-12-17.

Title Artwork Design In the silent era of the 1920s and early ’30s, the typography of a film’s title card created a mood, set the scene, and reminded an audience of the type of film they’d paid to see. Cartoon title cards were also branding, mood, and scene-setting, all rolled into one. In the early years, when major studio budgets were bigger, these title cards were often illustrative and painterly. Source: smashingmagazine.com. Date: 2025-12-17.
