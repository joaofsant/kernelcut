The agency deferred action on the rest of the second-generation constellation at the time and limited the first batch to certain altitudes, saying it needed to \"address concerns about orbital debris and space safety\" before approving the full bunch.

How to do it and how much to spend on it remain unresolved questions. Much of the discourse around reusable rockets in Europe has focused on developing a brand new rocket that might eventually replace the Ariane 6, which debuted less than two years ago but still uses the use it and lose it model embraced by the launch industry for most of the Space Age. The European Space Agency (ESA) is offering money to emerging rocket companies in Europe to prove their small satellite launchers can do the job. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2026-01-10.
