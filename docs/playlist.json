    "summary_long": "It’s long been known that X (and Twitter before it) is a major venue for foreign influence campaigns to meddle in American politics. Much of the focus has been on Russian troll farms, which the US government has targeted on several occasions. But the launch of X’s About This Account feature may have revealed the scope and geographical breadth of its foreign troll problem. Almost immediately after the feature launched, people started noticing that many rage-bait accounts focused on US politics appeared to be based outside of the US. Source: www.theverge.com.

    "summary_long": "After years of introducing major changes with its annual iOS releases, Apple may be altering its approach next time around, instead focusing on refinement over a bevy of flashy new features. According to Mark Gurman in this week's Power On newsletter, for iOS 27, Apple is \"focused on improving the software’s quality and underlying performance.\" That, and beefing up its AI offerings. On the heels of iOS 26, which brought the Liquid Glass design overhaul, and the trickle of underbaked AI features that have arrived since the rollout of Apple Intelligence last year, Apple is reportedly honing in to improve the experience. Gurman writes that \"engineering teams are now combing through Apple’s operating systems, hunting for bloat to cut, bugs to eliminate, and any opportunity to meaningfully boost performance and overall quality.\" Gurman compares the strategy to 2009's Snow Leopard release for Mac, which focused on bug fixes, decluttering and efficiency.
