    "summary_long": "Waymo is set to expand its self-driving taxi service onto highways in three US cities on Wednesday, an advance for the venture owned by Google’s parent company that raises the stakes on safety. The company said it would add the high-speed roads to its routes in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco, allowing Waymo cars to ferry passengers to more destinations including San Jose International Airport. Waymo’s rollout on highways marks a significant step for the robotaxi operator as it aims to encourage the mass adoption of driverless vehicles. It is the first time a company will carry out paid driverless services on the highway without a driver behind the wheel. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-11-13.

The centerpiece of Amazon- and Blue Origin-founder Jeff Bezos’ space ambitious, the towering 321-foot tall New Glenn rocket’s seven methane-burning main engines ignited at 3:55 p.m. EST, majestically pushing the booster skyward atop 3.8 million pounds of thrust. The launching came four days late due to stormy weather on Earth and in space where a powerful solar storm buffeted the upper atmosphere with a torrent of high-energy radiation that could have caused electrical problems with the rocket or its payloads.

In October, the country's Competition Appeal Tribunal determined that Apple benefited from \"near absolute market power\" over app distribution and in-app payments and was \"abusing its dominant position by charging excessive and unfair prices\" as developer commission. At the time, Apple was reportedly planning to appeal, but today, the Tribunal refused to give the company permission to challenge its decision. That means Apple's next recourse, if it wants to not pony up more than £1 billion in damages, is to take its case directly to the UK Court of Appeal. Source: www.engadget.com. Date: 2025-11-13.
