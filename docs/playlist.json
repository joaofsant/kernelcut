More recently, the team has been working on Sky, a context-aware AI interface layer on top of macOS. The financial terms of the acquisition have not been publicly disclosed. “AI progress isn’t only about advancing intelligence—it’s about unlocking it through interfaces that understand context, adapt to your intent, and work seamlessly,” an OpenAI rep wrote in the company’s blog post about the acquisition.

The new, yet-to-be-named company aims to come online in 2027, pending regulatory approval and other logistics. Airbus would own a majority of this new venture with a 35 percent stake, with Leonardo and Thales owning 32.5 percent respectively. In their joint press release, the companies said that they would pool the following resources: * Airbus will contribute with its Space Systems and Space Digital businesses, coming from Airbus Defence and Space * Leonardo will contribute with its Space Division, including its shares in Telespazio and Thales Alenia Space * Thales will mainly contribute with its shares in Thales Alenia Space, Telespazio, and Thales SESO “By pooling our talent, resources, expertise and R&D capabilities, we aim to generate growth, accelerate innovation…",

    "summary_long": "Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming, particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN) through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects. Source: arxiv.org. Date: 2025-10-23.
