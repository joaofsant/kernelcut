    "summary_long": "The UK government has issued a new order to Apple to create a backdoor into its cloud storage service, this time targeting only British users’ data, despite US claims that Britain had abandoned all attempts to break the tech giant’s encryption. The UK Home Office demanded in early September that Apple create a means to allow officials access to encrypted cloud backups, but stipulated that the order applied only to British citizens’ data, according to people briefed on the matter. A previous technical capability notice (TCN) issued in January sought global access to encrypted user data. That move sparked a diplomatic clash between the UK and US governments and threatened to derail the two nations’ efforts to secure a trade agreement. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-10-01.

    "summary_long": "OpenAI and Apple have moved to dismiss a lawsuit by Elon Musk's xAI alleging that ChatGPT's integration into a \"handful\" of iPhone features violated antitrust laws by giving OpenAI a monopoly on prompts and Apple a new path to block rivals in the smartphone industry. The lawsuit was filed in August after Musk raged on X about Apple never listing Grok on its editorially curated \"Must Have\" apps list, which ChatGPT frequently appeared on. According to Musk, Apple linking ChatGPT to Siri and other native iPhone features gave OpenAI exclusive access to billions of prompts that only OpenAI can use as valuable training data to maintain its dominance in the chatbot market. However, OpenAI and Apple are now mocking Musk's math in court filings, urging the court to agree that xAI's lawsuit is doomed. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-10-01.

According to a press release, Wyden is specifically looking at whether Morehead \"misrepresent[ed] his residency status\" when Pantera generated over $1 billion in capital gains from crypto sales by claiming his profits from the sale came while he was in Puerto Rico.
