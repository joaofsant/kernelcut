    "summary_long": "Shortly before the US military launched an attack on Venezuela and captured President Nicolás Maduro, an account on Polymarket made some very suspiciously timed investments. The prediction market had been running bets on when or if Maduro would be removed from power, with prices for \"out by January 31, 2026\" as low as $0.07 late Friday evening. But within 24 hours of the military action, a newly created account invested tens of thousands of dollars, racking up several hundred thousand in profits. The account was created less than a week ago, and invested over $30,000 the day before the assault, turning a profit of over $408,000. Source: www.theverge.com. Date: 2026-01-03.

On January 1, the state launched its Delete Request and Opt-out Platform, shortened to DROP, that allows residents to request to delete all of their personal information online that's been harvested by data brokers. According to the California Privacy Protection Agency (CalPrivacy), which was responsible for DROP's release, it's a \"first of its kind\" tool that imposes new restrictions on businesses that hoard and sell personal info that consumers didn't provide directly. The process requires verifying your California residency before you can send a \"single deletion request to every registered data broker in California.\" On the other end, CalPrivacy will require data brokers to register every year and to process any deletion requests from DROP.

Case in point is Bosch's automotive plans at CES. The company is showcasing what it calls \"AI in the car,\" or more specifically, in the cockpit of the car. Source: www.engadget.com.
