However, I can't help thinking that the answer for a TV that truly prioritizes the needs of older people is much simpler—and cheaper. On Thursday, LG announced the Easy TV in South Korea, aiming it at the “senior TV market,” according to a Google translation of the press release. One of the features that LG has included in attempts to appeal to this demographic is a remote control with numbers. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-09-26.

But they waited all the way until Thursday night to reveal preorder pricing set at $599.99 for the base ROG Xbox Ally hardware and a whopping $999.99 for the souped-up ROG Xbox Ally X. Those prices put the baseline ROG Xbox Ally units in the same general price tier as competition like Valve's Steam Deck OLED, Lenovo's Legion Go S, and even Nintendo's Switch 2. But the higher-grade ROG Xbox Ally X is significantly more expensive than almost all competing gaming handhelds, thanks in part to components like a Ryzen Z2 Extreme processor and an NPU that Asus says will ensure it is ready for a future when \"AI enhancements\" are rolling out in new games.
