    "summary_long": "Yesterday, Ubisoft confirmed that Rainbow Six Siege had been compromised and that it had shut down the game's servers and marketplace while it resolved the issue. The hackers managed to gain control over a significant chunk of the game's systems, including the ability to ban and unban users, sending custom messages to ban ticker, unlocking all in-game items, and granting every player 2 billion R6 Credits and Renown. Ubisoft sells R6 credits in its store, pricing 15,000 of them at $99.99. That means the actual cash value of 2 billion R6 credits is about $13.33 million. Source: www.theverge.com. Date: 2025-12-28.

    "summary_long": "Apple isn't ready to pay a several billion-dollar fine to UK App Store users and is filing an appeal over a major antitrust lawsuit. As first reported by The Guardian, Apple has requested to appeal to the UK's Court of Appeal, which would escalate the case beyond the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT). The latest appeal attempt follows an October decision from the CAT, where the court found that Apple engaged in anticompetitive practices by exploiting its dominant market position with the App Store to charge higher fees. The CAT's ruling established a £1.5 billion, or roughly $2 billion, fine, but Apple said it planned to appeal and that the court \"takes a flawed view of the thriving and competitive app economy.\" The CAT didn't grant Apple the appeal, leading the iPhone maker to seek a higher court to overturn the ruling.
