The rally carried the token from $2.96 to $2.99 in 24 hours, with midday breakouts on volumes six times the daily average. Despite facing resistance near $3.02, the market structure suggests accumulation, with bulls defending support around $2.98 as traders gauge momentum for a push toward higher extension levels. NEWS BACKGROUND • The September 10 midday rally was fueled by a volume explosion of 116.7M and 119.0M units within the 12:00–13:00 hour, far exceeding the 24-hour average of 48.3M.

The Falcon 9 took off from Vandenberg Space Force Base, California, at 7:12 am PDT (10:12 am EDT; 14:12 UTC) and headed south over the Pacific Ocean, heading for an orbit over the poles before releasing the 21 military-owned satellites to begin several weeks of activations and checkouts. These 21 satellites will boost themselves to a final orbit at an altitude of roughly 600 miles (1,000 kilometers). The Pentagon plans to launch 133 more satellites over the next nine months to complete the build-out of the Space Development Agency's first-generation, or Tranche 1, constellation of missile tracking and data relay satellites.

The mountains in northern Colorado offer similar visual illusions and flight environments to the Moon.

The FLM uses a simple feedforward structure with cosine activation functions to learn the frequencies, amplitudes, and phase shifts of the series as trainable parameters. This design allows the model to create a problem-specific spectral basis adaptable to both periodic and nonperiodic functions. Unlike previous Fourier-inspired NN models, the FLM is the first architecture able to represent a complete, separable Fourier basis in multiple dimensions using a standard Multilayer Perceptron-like architecture.

Like human cognitive development, agents are expected to acquire knowledge and skills through exploration and interaction with the environment. Despite advances, the community still lacks a unified, interactive reinforcement learning (RL) framework that can effectively train such agents from scratch -- without relying on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) -- across diverse and realistic environments. To bridge this gap, we introduce AgentGym-RL, a new framework to train LLM agents for multi-turn interactive decision-making through RL. Source: arxiv.org. Date: 2025-09-10.
