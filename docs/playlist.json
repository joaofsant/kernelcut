Last August, Peloton laid off six percent of its workforce and told investors it would continue layoffs globally in 2026, in an attempt to cut at least $100 million of annual spending by the end of the fiscal year. Peloton's latest strategy shift to reverse the effect of its pandemic-era boom stalling out has also brought new hardware with Peloton IQ AI features.

How is it, then, that an Android-powered set-top box from 2015 is still going strong? Nvidia released the first Shield Android TV in 2015, and according to the company's senior VP of hardware engineering, Andrew Bell, supporting these devices has been a labor of love.

We look forward to building upon those capabilities with many private astronaut missions to come.” Axiom Mission 5 is expected to spend up to 14 days aboard the space station. Source: www.nasa.gov.

Some of these files were specifically designed to make pornographic images banned by the site, a new analysis has found. The study, from researchers at Stanford and Indiana University, looked at people’s requests for content on the site, called “bounties.” The researchers found that between mid-2023 and the end of 2024, most bounties asked for animated content—but a significant portion were for deepfakes of real people, and 90% of these deepfake requests targeted women. (Their findings have not yet been peer reviewed.) The debate around deepfakes, as illustrated by the recent backlash to explicit images on the X-owned chatbot Grok, has revolved around what platforms should do to block such content.
