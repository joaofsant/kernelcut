The Starlink 11-21 mission will add another 28 more of the V2 Mini iteration of the satellites into low Earth orbit. An on-time liftoff would break the record for the fastest pad turnaround for SpaceX’s West Coast launch pad, coming just under 55 hours since the Starlink 11-12 mission on Saturday. The company has already set turnaround records this month on both coasts. Source: spaceflightnow.com. Date: 2025-10-26. Why it matters: outline likely impact on technology, business, or society.

We've already seen the vapor chamber included in the iPhone 17 Pro models, helping to boost cooling and performance. While an iPad's larger surface area makes for greater heat dissipation than an iPhone, this cooling system should make the tablet more capable when it comes to demanding tasks, like gaming, video editing or AI apps.
