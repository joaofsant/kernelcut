Meta also failed to give users an effective way to challenge content moderation decisions, the EC said. “When it comes to Meta, neither Facebook nor Instagram appear to provide a user-friendly and easily accessible ‘Notice and Action’ mechanism for users to flag illegal content, such as child sexual abuse material and terrorist content,” the EC press release said. The EC said that Meta mechanisms seem to “impose several unnecessary steps and additional demands on users. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-10-24.

Roughly 100,000 of the casualties died in battle, while as many as 300,000 perished from a combination of the bitter cold of Russia’s notoriously harsh winter, starvation, and disease. Scholars have debated precisely what kinds of diseases ravaged Napoleon’s troops. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-10-24. Why it matters: outline likely impact on technology, business, or society.

Automattic believes that following a $250 million investment from Silver Lake, which gave the firm a controlling interest in WP Engine, the hosting provider \"sought to inflate its valuation and engineer a quick, lucrative exit.\" It allegedly did that, per the counterclaim, by describing itself as the \"WordPress Technology Company\" and allowing its partners to refer to it as \"WordPress Engine,\" violations of the WordPress trademark. Automattic claims products WP Engine released like \"Core WordPress\" and \"Headless WordPress\" further obfuscated the company’s role, while WP Engine also failed to commit a promised \"five percent of its resources to support the WordPress project.\"…",
