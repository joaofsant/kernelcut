    "summary_long": "Forty years ago today, the Nintendo Entertainment System launched in North America, and to help celebrate the anniversary, 8BitDo has announced a new NES40 collection. It features updated versions of three of 8BitDo’s existing products, including its Ultimate 2 wireless controller, Retro 87 Keyboard N Edition, and Retro Cube Speaker. The updates made to the N40 version of 8BitDo’s Ultimate 2 controller are mostly cosmetic, but it now features a black-and-gray design with bright red buttons and a charging dock that matches the aesthetics of the NES console. The controller will also include four swappable joystick caps while its grips are printed with dates that correlate to launches of notable Nintendo and 8BitDo products. Source: www.theverge.com.

Meta said at the time that Pegasus can infect targets' devices even without their participation by sending text messages with malicious codes to WhatsApp. Even a missed call is enough to infect somebody's device.
