    "summary_long": "The amazingly thin wallpaper design from LG is back. The first Wallpaper TV was released back in 2017, and it's been six years since we saw the last one. But LG has revived the product line with the LG OLED evo W6, and I've seen it here at CES. The TV body is only 9mm thick (which is actually a bit more than the last model), thanks to a completely reengineered internal architecture. Source: www.theverge.com. Date: 2026-01-05.

Following an $8 30W version that launched in 2024 and a $35 65W option that debuted earlier this year, the new 20W Sjöss is now available online and through many of Ikea's physical US stores for just $3.99. That's considerably cheaper than Apple's $19 20W USB-C Power Adapter while being comparable in size, and cheaper than Anker's $11.99 Nano Pro 20W USB-C charger.
