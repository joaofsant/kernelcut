The iPhone 17e will feature an upgraded A19 chip from the iPhone 17 lineup, plus MagSafe charging, and move Apple's in-house cellular chips. Just as importantly, the company apparently plans to keep the price at $599, despite soaring RAM and storage prices. Gurman says Apple is planning to pitch the iPhone 17e aggressively in emerging markets and to enterprises. Source: www.theverge.com. Date: 2026-02-08.
