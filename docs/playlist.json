    "summary_long": "Morrow County, Oregon is home to mega farms and food processing plants. But it’s also home to several Amazon data centers. And now, some experts believe, that combination is leading to an alarmingly high concentration of nitrates in the drinking water that is driving up cancer and miscarriage rates in the area. Rolling Stone’s exposé details how Amazon, despite not using any dangerous nitrates to cool its data centers, is accelerating the contamination of the Lower Umatilla Basin aquifer, which residents rely on for drinking water.

In a study published by Icaro Lab called \"Adversarial Poetry as a Universal Single-Turn Jailbreak Mechanism in Large Language Models,\" researchers were able to bypass various LLMs' safety mechanisms by phrasing their prompt with poetry. According to the study, the \"poetic form operates as a general-purpose jailbreak operator,\" with results showing an overall 62 percent success rate in producing prohibited material, including anything related to making nuclear weapons, child sexual abuse materials and suicide or self-harm. The study tested popular LLMs, including OpenAI's GPT models, Google Gemini, Anthropic's Claude and many more. Source: www.engadget.com. Date: 2025-11-30.

As first discovered by Tibor Blaho on X, a beta version of ChatGPT's Android app includes lines of code that heavily reference ads. According to the post, the 1.2025.329 beta version includes mentions of \"ads feature,\" \"search ad\" and \"bazaar content.\" While this isn't a version that's available to the public yet, it could be an indication that OpenAI is ready to open the ad floodgates.
