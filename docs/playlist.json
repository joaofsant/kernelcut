Barring any unforeseen problems, SpaceX will mark the 500th re-flight of a Falcon first stage later this year. A handful of other US companies, including Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, Relativity Space, and Stoke Space, are on the way to replicating or building on SpaceX's achievements in recycling rocket parts. These launch providers are racing a medley of Chinese rocket builders to become the second company to land and reuse a first stage booster. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-09-22.

These teardowns got pretty routine for a while, as Apple settled into a fairly consistent design for iPhones, but the new design of the iPhone Air offered an opportunity for compelling observations. Many of the important components—including the entire logic board—are clustered up at the top of the phone, while the majority of its middle and body house a battery. iFixit found that this battery is identical to the one included in Apple's iPhone Air MagSafe battery pack—you can even swap the batteries between the pack and the phone with no problems.

The case that just got underway is the remedy phase of the AdTech trial, in which the DOJ secured a ruling against Google several months ago. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-09-22.

We present Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by $\\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output distribution.
