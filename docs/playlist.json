According to Bloomberg's Mark Gurman, Apple wants to announce a new Siri in \"the second half of February\" that will show off the results of its recently announced partnership with Google and offer demonstrations of the Gemini-powered capabilities. After this reveal, Gurman reported that the new Siri will make its way to iOS 26.4, which is also slated to enter beta testing in February before its public release in March or early April. Apple has been meaning to launch its next-gen Siri ever since its announcement at WWDC 2024, but now we know that this Gemini-powered Siri will behave more like an AI chatbot, similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT, thanks to another Bloomberg report from last week.
