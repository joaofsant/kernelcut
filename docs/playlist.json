A National Geographic camera crew was on hand for the 2022 expedition that documented the new species—and so was actor Will Smith, since they were filming for NatGeo's new documentary series, Pole to Pole with Will Smith. Now we can all share in Smith's Amazon experience, courtesy of the three-minute clip above. Along with venom expert Bryan Fry, we follow Smith's journey by boat with a team of indigenous Waorani guides, scouring the river banks for anacondas. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2026-01-11.
