As first reported by Bloomberg, the latest filing, as part of a lawsuit that accuses the AI giant of abandoning its non-profit status, claims that Musk is owed anywhere between $79 billion and $134 billion in damages from the \"wrongful gains\" of OpenAI and Microsoft. Musk claimed in the filing that he's entitled to a portion of OpenAI's recent valuation at $500 billion, after contributing $38 million in \"seed funding\" during the AI company's startup years. Along with providing \"roughly 60 percent of the nonprofit's seed funding,\" Musk offered recruiting of key employees, introductions with business contacts and startup advice, according to the filing.
