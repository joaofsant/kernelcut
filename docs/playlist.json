Some people posted videos of Teslas using their FSD feature to navigate the same streets, and Elon Musk tweeted that \"Tesla Robotaxis were unaffected by the SF power outage.\" On Sunday evening, Waymo spokesperson Suzanne Philion said, \"We are resuming ride-hailing service in the San Francisco Bay Area.\" Read the full story at The Verge.

If you'd rather not end up with joysticks that have a mind of their own, GuliKit revealed its latest TMR Electromagnet Joystick Modules made specifically for your Xbox handheld. GuliKit said it worked directly with Asus to develop these joystick upgrades, which match the exact dimensions of the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X's stock sticks. The aftermarket accessories company previously designed a Hall effect joystick upgrade kit for the ROG Ally X, but GuliKit said this mod features electromagnetic joysticks that not only address stick drift but are also more precise, durable, and power-efficient.
