    "summary_long": "Around the world, some 40 million people are living with HIV. And though progress in treatment means the infection isn’t the death sentence it once was, researchers have never been able to bring about a cure. Instead, HIV-positive people must take a cocktail of antiretroviral drugs for the rest of their lives. But in 2025, researchers reported a breakthrough that suggests that a “functional” cure for HIV—a way to keep HIV under control long-term without constant treatment—may indeed be possible.

As first revealed by Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, the development team confirmed that it's working on a content update that could be similar in scale to the Hollow Knight: Godmaster DLC. According to the report, the new content could feature Steel Assassin Sharpe, a mysterious character that was teased several years ago but never made an official in-game appearance.
