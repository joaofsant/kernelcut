Glass made a lot of people dream about new ways to use computers without staring down at screens all day. Glass also made a lot of people realize just how bad it might feel to have a world full of face computers. Source: www.theverge.com. Date: 2025-12-07.

A team of geneticists recently found no connection between simple genetic variants and behavioral traits in more than 3,200 dogs, even though previous studies suggested that hundreds of genes might predict aspects of a dog’s behavior and personality. That’s despite the popularity of at-home genetic tests that claim they can tell you whether your dog’s genes contain the recipe for anxiety or a fondness for cuddles. This is Max, and no single genetic variant can explain why he is the way he is. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-12-07. Why it matters: outline likely impact on technology, business, or society.

Nikita Bier, X's head of product, accused the European Commission of using an exploit to artificially boost the reach of its post announcing the major fine. In the post, Bier said that the commission \"logged into [their] dormant ad account to take advantage of an exploit in our Ad Composer\" and posted \"a link that deceives users into thinking it’s a video and to artificially increase its reach.\" Bier explained in a separate post that the exploit has \"never been abused like this\" and \"is now patched.\" However, X still revoked the European Commission's ability to buy and track ads on its platform. While X decided to remove the European Commission's ad account, it still needs to submit specific measures and an action plan to address the concerns associated with the $140 million fine.

OpenAI's Daniel McAuley responded to the post, arguing that it's not an ad but rather an example of app integration that the company announced in October. Source: www.engadget.com. Date: 2025-12-07.
