    "summary_long": "NASA officials said Thursday they have decided to bring home four of the seven crew members on the International Space Station after one of them experienced a \"medical situation\" earlier this week. The space agency has said little about the incident, and officials have not identified which crew member suffered the medical issue. James \"JD\" Polk, NASA's chief health and medical officer, told reporters Thursday the crew member is \"absolutely stable\" but that the agency is \"erring on the side of caution\" with the decision to bring to return the astronaut to Earth. The ailing astronaut is part of the Crew-11 mission, which launched to the station August 1 and was slated to come back to Earth around February 20. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2026-01-09.

This might sound creepy, but it can also be legal when used by a parent monitoring their child or an employee monitoring their workers. These are exactly the use cases that were once outlined on pcTattletale's website, where the software was said to have \"helped tens of thousands of parents stop their daughters from meeting up with pedophiles.\" Businesses can \"track productivity, theft, lost hours, and more.\" Even \"police departments use it for investigating.\" But this week, nearly 25 years after launching pcTattletale, Fleming pled guilty in federal court to having knowingly built and marketed software to spy on other adults without their consent. In other words, pcTattletale was often used to spy on romantic partners without their knowledge—and Fleming helped people do it. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2026-01-08.

Dell claims the UltraSharp 52 Thunderbolt Hub Monitor is the first 52-incher to market that’s also ultrawide, curved and supports 6K resolution (but with that many qualifiers almost anything can be a world first).
