Founded in 2023, xAI's main products are the generative AI chatbot, Grok, and the social media site X, formerly known as Twitter. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2026-02-02.

The post said that the attack began last June with an “infrastructure-level compromise that allowed malicious actors to intercept and redirect update traffic destined for notepad-plus-plus.org.” The attackers, whom multiple investigators tied to the Chinese government, then selectively redirected certain targeted users to malicious update servers where they received backdoored updates.

We address this gap by manually annotating failed agent runs and release a novel benchmark of 115 failed trajectories spanning structured API workflows, incident management, and open-ended web/file tasks. Each trajectory is annotated with a critical failure step and a category from a grounded-theory derived, cross-domain failure taxonomy. To mitigate the human cost of failure attribution, we present AGENTRX, an automated domain-agnostic diagnostic framework that pinpoints the critical failure step in a failed agent trajectory.

    "summary_long": "Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in many complex tasks, yet they can still fail in very simple logical reasoning such as the \"reversal curse\" -- when trained on forward knowledge data of the form \"$A \\rightarrow B$\" (e.g., Alice's husband is Bob), the model is unable to deduce the reversal knowledge \"$B \\leftarrow A$\" (e.g., Bob's wife is Alice) during test. Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form \"$A \\to A$\" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the…",

    "summary_long": "Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising distributed machine learning (ML) that enables collaborative model training across clients without exposing raw data, thereby preserving user privacy and reducing communication costs. Despite these benefits, traditional single-server FL suffers from high communication latency due to the aggregation of models from a large number of clients. While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems.
