The company says the next available launch opportunity is Wednesday, November 12, with a window opening at 2:50 pm EST (19:50 UTC). CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida—The field of astrodynamics isn’t a magical discipline, but sometimes it seems trajectory analysts can pull a solution out of a hat. That’s what it took to save NASA’s ESCAPADE mission from a lengthy delay, and possible cancellation, after its rocket wasn’t ready to send it toward Mars during its appointed launch window last year.

Once demoed on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and at splashy E3 press conferences, in 2016, No Man's Sky was heralded as gaming's future. And it was all made possible by the procedural generation that spawned its vast, sci-fi universe. Nearly a decade later, as post-rock band 65daysofstatic returns to re-score the ever-evolving game, generated content is no longer the exciting futurism it once seemed. Source: www.theverge.com.

OneXPlayer launched its latest Indiegogo campaign for its upcoming handheld that starts at $1,399 and goes up to $2,299 for a fully kitted-out version. While most portable gamers are better off with the Steam Deck, the OneXFly Apex separates itself from the crowd with high-end specs, an external 85Wh battery, and the option for liquid cooling. OneXPlayer hasn't divulged the estimated play time you'll get with its massive battery, but it's designed to be quickly swapped out with a spare battery that's sold separately.
