    "summary_long": "Human video demonstrations provide abundant training data for learning robot policies, but video alone cannot capture the rich contact signals critical for mastering manipulation. We introduce OSMO, an open-source wearable tactile glove designed for human-to-robot skill transfer. The glove features 12 three-axis tactile sensors across the fingertips and palm and is designed to be compatible with state-of-the-art hand-tracking methods for in-the-wild data collection. We demonstrate that a robot policy trained exclusively on human demonstrations collected with OSMO, without any real robot data, is capable of executing a challenging contact-rich manipulation task.

    "summary_long": "Kernel density estimation is a key component of a wide variety of algorithms in machine learning, Bayesian inference, stochastic dynamics and signal processing. However, the unsupervised density estimation technique requires tuning a crucial hyperparameter: the kernel bandwidth. The choice of bandwidth is critical as it controls the bias-variance trade-off by over- or under-smoothing the topological features. Topological data analysis provides methods to mathematically quantify topological characteristics, such as connected components, loops, voids et cetera, even in high dimensions where visualization of density estimates is impossible.

NASA/Brandon Torres-Navarrete NASA is helping shape the future of urban air travel with a new simulation that will manage how electric air taxis and drones can successfully operate within busy areas. The demonstration, held at NASA’s Ames Research Center in California’s Silicon Valley earlier this year, focused on a system called the Strategic Deconfliction Simulation, which helps coordinate flight plans before takeoff, reducing the risk of conflicts in busy urban environments At the event, researchers demonstrated NASA’s Situational Viewer and Demand-Capacity Balancing Monitor, which visualizes air traffic and adjusts flight plans in real time. The simulation demonstrated traffic scenarios involving drone operations throughout the Dallas-Fort Worth area, testing how preplanned flights could improve congestion and manage the demand and capacity of the airspace –…",
