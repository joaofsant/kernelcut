It's hard not to compare the Kodak Charmera to the ubiquitous Labubu craze, considering the highly collectible nature of Reto Pro selling these officially licensed mini cameras as a single blind box for $29.99 or a full set of six for $179.94. The keyring cameras, which only weigh 30 grams, are already sold out on the Reto Pro website, but are expected to be restocked. The blind box can be unwrapped for one of seven designs, including one secret version that has a transparent shell to show off the tiny camera's internals. Source: www.engadget.com. Date: 2025-09-13.
