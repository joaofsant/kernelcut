One of the missions, from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), will beam back real-time observations of the solar wind to provide advance warning of geomagnetic storms that could affect power grids, radio communications, GPS navigation, air travel, and satellite operations. The other two missions come from NASA, with research objectives that include studying the boundary between the Solar System and interstellar space and observing the rarely seen outermost layer of our own planet's atmosphere.

The massive buildout aims to handle ChatGPT's 700 million weekly users and train future AI models, although critics question whether the investment structure can sustain itself. The companies said the expansion puts them on track to secure the full $500 billion, 10-gigawatt commitment they announced in January by the end of 2025. The five new sites will include three locations developed through an OpenAI and Oracle partnership: Shackelford County, Texas; Doña Ana County, New Mexico; and an unspecified Midwest location.

To make matters worse, the token linked to defunct crypto exchange FTX surged nearly 24% in the last 24 hours, after his X account posted a simple \"gm\" on Tuesday. This simple post seems to have been taken as an opportunity by speculative crypto traders to pump the FTT token, which now has no value associated with it, nearly 50%-60% within minutes, reaching a peak of around $1.20-$1.23. Despite his incarceration and clarification that the post was made by a \"friend\" on his behalf, the token is still up 25%, trading around $1.014, according to CoinDesk data.

Motivated by SimPO's strong performance in offline preference optimization, we investigate whether Maximum Entropy RL can achieve similar results in online RLHF settings. Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization. Source: arxiv.org.
