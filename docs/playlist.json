The SDA was formed as an independent agency 2019 with the goal of safeguarding the United States against hypersonic weapons and offering a network of satellites and ground support systems that could unify the Department of Defense’s capabilities across a “resilient, threat-driven space surveillance and communications architecture,” according its establishing memorandum. It became a part of the U.S. Space Force in October 2022. Source: spaceflightnow.com. Date: 2025-09-10. Why it matters: outline likely impact on technology, business, or society.

    "summary_long": "XRP struggled to maintain momentum above the $3.00 threshold on September 9–10, with heavy institutional selling wiping out early gains. Despite a push to $3.035, volume-driven liquidation erased upside attempts and pulled the asset back to $2.94 by session close. The move is indicative of mounting resistance near $3.02, even as traders weigh ETF catalysts and rising exchange reserves that may temper bullish momentum. NEWS BACKGROUND • Federal Reserve’s September 17 meeting is expected to deliver a 25-basis-point rate cut, with markets assigning near-certainty to the outcome — a potential liquidity driver for risk assets.

This study explores Android penetration testing automation using LLM-based tools, especially PentestGPT, to identify and execute rooting techniques. Through a comparison of the traditional manual rooting process and exploitation methods produced using AI, this study evaluates the efficacy, reliability, and scalability of automated penetration testing in achieving high-level privilege access on Android devices. With the use of an Android emulator (Genymotion) as the testbed, we fully execute both traditional and exploit-based rooting methods, automating the process using AI-generated scripts.

    "summary_long": "As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds, these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX 4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no architectural changes. Source: arxiv.org.
