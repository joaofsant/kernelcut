According to YouTuber Rebs Gaming, a source claimed that Halo Studios, previously known as 343 Industries, is working on a multiplayer Halo title that could borrow Fortnite's model of constantly pushing out content updates. The report also noted that there aren't any mentions of Fortnite's battle royale style for the upcoming game. Source: www.engadget.com. Date: 2025-10-19.
