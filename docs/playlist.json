We need to make moves to ensure our survival and intact mental health.” MANUFACTURING BOGUS BUGS His comments came as cURL users complained that the move was treating the symptoms caused by AI slop without addressing the cause.

Such operations are critical when surface access is not possible and stealthy navigation is required in restricted environments such as protected zones or dangerous areas under access ban. GNSS denied navigation is then essential to maintaining concealment as surfacing could expose UUVs to detection. To ensure a precise fleet positioning a constellation of beacons deployed by aerial or surface drones establish a synthetic landmark network that will guide the fleet of UUVs along an optimized path from the continental shelf to the goal on the shore.
