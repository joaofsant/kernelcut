Bitcoin’s market dominance has dropped 3.5% in the past month, and its underperformance relative to altcoins has now seen altcoin season indexes, which measure the performance of top cryptocurrencies against BTC, enter “altseason” territory. Altseason, short for altcoin season, refers to a period in which alternative cryptocurrencies significantly outperform bitcoin. It often starts as capital rotates out of bitcoin amid growing risk appetite. Source: www.coindesk.com. Date: 2025-09-13. Why it matters: outline likely impact on technology, business, or society.

THE NARRATIVE On Wednesday, at CoinDesk's Policy and Regulation event, one major topic of conversation was a post from former Commodity Futures Trading Commission Commissioner Brian Quintenz in which he shared chat logs from a conversation with Gemini co-founder and CEO Tyler Winklevoss, an unexpected move from a former public official waiting for the Senate to confirm him to head up the commodities regulator. WHY IT MATTERS Quintenz's path to becoming chair of the CFTC seemed clear until late July, when the Senate Agriculture Committee twice postponed a key vote to advance his nomination.

These moves, the administration said, were part of an effort to achieve American independence from foreign power providers by way of a “nuclear energy renaissance.” Self-reliance isn’t the only factor motivating nuclear power proponents outside of the administration: Following a decades-long trend away from nuclear energy, in part due to safety concerns and high costs, the technology has emerged as a potential option to try to mitigate climate change. Through nuclear fission, in which atoms are split to release energy, reactors don’t emit any greenhouse gases. The Trump administration wants to quadruple the nuclear sector’s domestic energy production, with the goal of producing 400 gigawatts by 2050. Source: arstechnica.com. Date: 2025-09-13.",
